Summary:
GlusterFS is a distributed File System. In this doc for build a environment of glusterfs, I am able to show you how to create and configure 
GlusterFS Server on three nodes. You can create different types of GlusterFS volumes. We will only show you how to configure a replicated 
volume so that if you store a file on one machine, it will get replicated to all the nodes in the cluster. Suppose the hostnames of the 
three servers on which we want to install GlusterFS server are <bgsr29u11>, <bgsr29u13> and <bgsr29u15>. GlusterFS works better with 
hostnames instead of IP addresses so we'll use hostnames in the installation procedure

Here are the steps:
1) Install python-software-properties.
#apt-get install python-software-properties
#dpkg -l python-software-properties
