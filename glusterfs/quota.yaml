How to use and seting Quota option in Glusterfs on Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS

 Applying quota on directory is very common requirement. 
 In case of gluterfs we are also having the provision of applying the quota on directories. 
 In this article I am going to show how to use quota option in Glusterfs.
 
Step 1 : Before applying the quota on directory which is present in volume we need to enable the quota option at volume level.
# gluster vol quota test1-vol enable
  volume quota : success

 Step 2 : I have mounted the volume on client at mountpoint (/mnt) and I have created one directory beneath  it.
  # mount -t glusterfs dcosdemo03:/test1-vol /glsfs/
  # mkdir -p /glsfs/folder1
  # gluster vol quota test1-vol limit-usage /folder1 100MB
     volume quota : success
